'I am Little Astronaut' by Jean Warren

I'm a little astronaut-
    Flying to the moon     
        My rocket is ready,    
        We blast off soon.     
I climb aboard         
    And close the hatch.   
        5-4-3-2-1, off we blast!

'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' by Jane Taylor

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are!
        Up above the world so high,
        Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are!

"Do the right thing. It will gratify some people and astonish the rest."
